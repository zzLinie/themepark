# Themepark Management 
[Web App Link](https://gleaming-lokum-158537.netlify.app)
## Project description 

Our themepark management web app has 3 different roles for users to manage and be apart of our themepark 

## Customers
- Customers can view details about the park, buy tickets for their next visit, and register/login an account with us to manage their tickets. 
- Customer login is required to buy tickets. 
- if you are logged in as an admin or employee you are unable to buy tickets, you must register and login as a customer

## Employee
- Our Employee dashboard requires employees login using their employee email and password. 
- Employees main role in the dashboard is to perform database operations such as create, read, update, delete (soft delete).
- The employees are able to also view more park information such as ride popularity, upcoming events, and upcoming maintenance on park rides for our technicians.   

## Admin
- Just like employees, admins are required to login using their username and password.
- Admins have access to reports of the park that are generated based on filters from the user interface.
- Admins are able to perform data entry to create, update, read, delete new employees.
- Admins are also in charge of setting park operation days.
- The park operations days require the admins to create a park day, and the weather that day will have. 
- The Admins are able to view more park details such as capacity, which is dependent on the weather type and opening/closing time (constant time).
- Admins are also able to edit the park operation days.
- The last thing admins are able to do is view the park visits and ticket availibility.
